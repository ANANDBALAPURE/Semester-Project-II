**Results**

The Simple Plagiarism Checker achieved the following:

- **High Accuracy** in detecting directly copied and partially modified content.
- **Fast Processing**: Compared two 600-word documents in less than 2 seconds.
- **Support for Multiple File Formats**: TXT, DOCX, PDF handled with ease.
- **Plagiarism Report**: Generates similarity scores with highlighted matching text.

Sample Test Outcomes:

- Identical documents: 100% similarity.
- Paraphrased content: 60â€“75% similarity detected.
- Completely unique documents: Below 20% similarity.

**Discussions**

- The tool performs well for academic assignments and short reports.
- Cosine Similarity provides the most consistent results for large paragraphs.
- Levenshtein Distance is useful for minor edits and substitutions.
- Jaccard Index is sensitive to sentence structure, improving detection of reshuffled sentences.

**Challenges Faced**

- Handling large documents required memory optimization.
- PDF formatting sometimes introduced hidden characters.
- Balancing between false positives and missed similarities was a key tuning step.

**Improvements for the Future**

- Integration with online databases to detect web-based plagiarism.
- Use of semantic similarity models like BERT for advanced paraphrasing.
- Adding support for other languages like Hindi, Marathi, etc.
- Web-based deployment for broader access.
