i. Introduction of the TopicPlagiarism is a critical issue in academic, research, and content creation domains. It involves copying or reusing another personâ€™s work without proper citation, leading to ethical and legal concerns. With the rapid expansion of digital content, detecting plagiarism has become an essential task. A Simple Plagiarism Checker aims to automate the process of detecting textual similarities using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and similarity measurement algorithms.

ii. BackgroundTraditional plagiarism detection methods involve manual checking, which is time-consuming and ineffective. Existing plagiarism detection tools are often expensive or limited in functionality. The increasing availability of digital documents necessitates an efficient system that can analyze and compare large volumes of text in real time. The Simple Plagiarism Checker addresses this need by using advanced text-processing techniques to provide accurate similarity analysis.

iii. Problem StatementMany students, researchers, and writers struggle to ensure the originality of their work. The lack of accessible and efficient plagiarism detection tools makes it challenging to verify content authenticity. Manual methods are prone to errors and inefficiencies, making an automated solution necessary.

iv. Objectives

Develop an automated plagiarism detection tool to compare textual documents.

Implement similarity algorithms such as Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Similarity, and Levenshtein Distance.

Provide a user-friendly interface for text and document comparison.

Generate reports highlighting plagiarized sections with percentage similarity.

Optimize the tool for speed and accuracy in detecting copied content.

C. Literature Review

i. Summary of Existing Technologies/Methods/Solutions Relevant to the ProjectSeveral plagiarism detection techniques exist, ranging from simple keyword matching to complex machine learning-based models. Some popular tools include Turnitin, Grammarly, and Copyscape, which use a combination of lexical analysis, deep learning, and extensive web-based comparisons. However, these tools are often costly and limited in access. The Simple Plagiarism Checker focuses on accessible NLP techniques, making use of text vectorization and similarity metrics to efficiently compare content.

D. If Project is ML-based, Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Since this project focuses on text similarity rather than machine learning, EDA is not extensively required. However, basic text preprocessing such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and n-gram analysis is performed to enhance text c
