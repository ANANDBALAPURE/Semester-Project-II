**Introduction of the Topic**

Plagiarism is the act of using someone elseâ€™s intellectual property without proper citation. In today's digital age, where content is easily accessible and shareable, plagiarism has become a widespread problem. It affects students, educators, researchers, and content creators alike.

**Background**

Academic institutions and content platforms emphasize originality, yet manual methods to detect plagiarism are tedious, inefficient, and prone to error. While commercial software solutions exist, they are often expensive and not accessible to all users. The need for an open, reliable, and user-friendly plagiarism detection tool is more pressing than ever.

This project provides a solution through a Python-based application that performs document comparison using NLP techniques and similarity metrics. It empowers users to maintain originality by validating their content effectively.

**Problem Statement**

Manual plagiarism detection is:

- Time-consuming.
- Inaccurate, especially for paraphrased text.
- Limited in scale when comparing multiple documents.
- Unfeasible for students and institutions with restricted access to paid tools.

**Objectives**

The primary goals of this project include:

- To build an automated plagiarism detection system for text documents.
- To implement effective text comparison algorithms using NLP.
- To allow the comparison of multiple document formats such as TXT, DOCX, and PDF.
- To generate clear, readable reports indicating plagiarism percentage.
- To ensure the solution is scalable, efficient, and user-friendly.
