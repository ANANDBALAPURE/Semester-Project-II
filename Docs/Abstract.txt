1. Title:
AI-Powered Plagiarism Detection System

2. Domain:
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Text Analytics

3. Application:
• Academic Integrity: Prevents plagiarism in research papers, assignments, and publications.
• Content Verification: Ensures originality in blogs, articles, and reports.
• AI-Generated Text Detection: Identifies AI-generated content from models like ChatGPT.

4. Expected Algorithm/Processing:
• Phase 1: Basic Model using Flask + Cosine Similarity for text comparison.
• Phase 2: UI improvements, Multiple File Support, and NLTK-based text preprocessing.
• Phase 3: Advanced Features including TF-IDF for accuracy, SBERT for semantic similarity, and AI text 
detection.
• Algorithms Used: TF-IDF (Scikit-learn), Cosine Similarity, SBERT (Sentence-Transformers), AI Text 
Classifier (Hugging Face).

5. Expected Output from Project:
• Detects exact matches and paraphrased plagiarism using NLP.
• Provides a similarity score and flags AI-generated content.
• Generates detailed plagiarism reports with highlighted text similarities.
• Supports multiple file comparisons and database storage (SQLite).

6. Abstract (150-200 words):
This project presents an AI-powered plagiarism detection system that enhances traditional text 
comparison methods using machine learning and NLP techniques. The system is designed to identify 
copied, paraphrased, and AI-generated content by integrating multiple detection algorithms.
The system operates in three phases. Phase 1 involves a basic Flask-based web app that uses cosine 
similarity to compare input text with a reference database. Phase 2 enhances functionality by improving 
the UI (Bootstrap), supporting multiple file comparisons, and integrating NLTK for better text 
preprocessing. Phase 3 advances accuracy using TF-IDF for keyword-based similarity, SBERT 
embeddings for semantic understanding, and an AI text classifier to detect machine-generated content.
Users submit text via a web interface, which the system processes using tokenization, lemmatization, 
and vectorization techniques. The final plagiarism report highlights similarity scores, detected AI￾generated text, and potential plagiarism cases. Implemented using Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, Sentence￾Transformers, and Hugging Face, this project offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for 
academic integrity and content originality verification.
