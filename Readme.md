Simple Plagiarism Checker: Project Description

Plagiarism is a widespread issue in academic institutions, research, journalism, and content creation. It refers to the act of copying or using someone else's work without proper attribution. As digital content continues to grow, ensuring originality in written documents has become increasingly important. Manually checking for plagiarism is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. To address this, our project presents a *Simple Plagiarism Checker*, an automated tool designed to detect similarities between texts and identify potential instances of plagiarism.  

This plagiarism detection system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text similarity algorithms to analyze documents. By comparing the textual content, the system determines the percentage of similarity between two or more documents. The goal is to provide a fast, accurate, and user-friendly tool that helps users verify the originality of their content. The system is particularly beneficial for students, educators, researchers, and content creators who need to ensure their work is free from unintentional duplication.  

The project focuses on developing an efficient algorithm that preprocesses the input text by removing slopworks, tokenizing sentences, and applying stemming techniques. This improves the accuracy of similarity detection. Several text-matching techniques, including Cosine Similarity, Jacquard Similarity, and Levenshtein Distance, are implemented to compare documents and measure their level of similarity. The system then generates a detailed report that highlights plagiarized sections and provides a similarity percentage.  

One of the primary advantages of this tool is its ability to support multiple document formats, such as plain text (.txt), PDF (.pdf), and Microsoft Word (.docx). Users can either upload files or directly input text into the system. The tool processes the text efficiently and delivers results in real time, making it a convenient solution for plagiarism detection.  

Despite its advantages, the *Simple Plagiarism Checker* has some limitations. It primarily focuses on detecting exact text matches and struggles with deeply paraphrased content. Additionally, it does not compare text against an extensive online database, limiting its ability to detect plagiarism from external sources. However, the system can be enhanced by integrating more advanced NLP techniques, such as semantic analysis and deep learning-based text comparison.  

In conclusion, this project aims to provide a reliable and straightforward plagiarism detection system that meets the needs of students, researchers, and writers. By automating the plagiarism-checking process, the tool saves time, improves accuracy, and promotes academic integrity. Future improvements could include expanding the database, improving paraphrase detection, and integrating additional languages to enhance its effectiveness.
